# Mod Builder
- use the mod assembly created in the Mod Scripts tab to execute mods and build a mod pak from resulting modified items.
- first execute.  if nothing happens the mod assembly didn't build check log for each mod script to find error(s).
- then build mod pak (in memory).  after this you can use Mod Diffs tab to preview side-by-side changes made to pak items.
- finally save mod pak to disk, will default to game MODS folder, but can save anywhere.
- if saved in game MODS folder then mod will now appear in PAK Viewer tab pak combobox.
